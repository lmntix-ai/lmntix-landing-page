## Getting started

* First, ensure that node.js & pnpm are both installed.
* Run `pnpm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.
* When `pnpm` has finished with the install, run `pnpm run build` to recompile the `style.css` file in the root directory.

You're ready to go! The most useful task for rapid development is `pnpm run dev`, which rebuild the CSS every time you make a change in the HML or JS files.
